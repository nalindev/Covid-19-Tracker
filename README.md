## ðŸŒŸ About
It simply loads data from API and stores it in persistence storage (i.e. SQLite Database). Data will be always loaded from local database. Remote data (from API) and Local data is always synchronized.
- This makes it offline capable ðŸ˜ƒ. 
- Clean and Simple Material UI.
- It supports dark theme too ðŸŒ—.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
*   Android Studio 3.2+
*   Java JDK
